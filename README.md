Age: Employees aged 18-25 and 26-35 show higher attrition rates compared to older age groups.
Gender: More male employees (146) have left compared to female employees (84).
Education: Employees with life sciences and medical backgrounds have higher attrition rates.

Job-Related Analysis:
Job Role: Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have higher attrition compared to Research Scientists and Sales Representatives.

Why This Project?
The HR Analytics Dashboard project was conceived with the goal of addressing a critical issue faced by many organizations: employee attrition. High attrition rates can significantly impact a company's productivity, morale, and overall performance. By creating a comprehensive dashboard, we aimed to provide HR professionals with the necessary tools to understand the underlying causes of attrition and develop effective retention strategies.
